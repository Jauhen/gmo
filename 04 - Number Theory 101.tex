      \textbf{Counting Numbers} = $\{1,\ 2,\ 3,\ \ldots\}$ are the numbers we use for counting. 
      
      (Yes, this is the definition.)

      The brackets here mean “the set including.” 
      
      Mathematicians use $\mathbb{N}$ as the symbol for this set.\medskip

      \textbf{Whole Numbers} = $\{0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ \ldots\}$, so this is the set of counting numbers plus the element zero. 
      
      Mathematicians use $\mathbb{N}_0$ or $\mathbb{Z}_+$ as the symbol for this set.\medskip

      \textbf{Integers} = $\{\ldots,\ –3,\ –2,\ –1,\ 0,\ +1,\ +2,\ +3,\ \ldots\}$, so this set includes negative numbers as well. 
      
      Mathematicians use $\mathbb{Z}$ as the symbol for this set.\medskip

      The study of math, which involves the properties of integers, is called \textbf{Number Theory}.

      \begin{definition}
        A \textbf{prime number} (also a \textbf{prime}) is a counting number with exactly two different factors, namely the number itself and the number $1$. 
        
        First $10$ prime numbers: 
        \[ 2,\ 3,\ 5,\ 7,\ 11,\ 13,\ 17,\ 19,\ 23,\ 29,\ \ldots. \]
        \emph{Note that $2$ is the only even prime.}
      \end{definition}

      \begin{example}
        A \textbf{composite number} is a counting number that has \emph{at least three} different factors.\smallskip

        The \textbf{number $1$} is \emph{neither prime nor composite} since it has exactly one factor.
      \end{example}
      As a result, all counting numbers are split into $3$ groups:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item prime numbers, 
        \item composite numbers, and 
        \item the group with only number 1.

    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
      All counting numbers may be presented as a~product of prime numbers. The existence and uniqueness of this presentation are proven by the \textbf{fundamental theorem of arithmetic}.

      The process of presenting a number as a product of prime numbers is called \textbf{prime factorization}.
      \begin{problem}
        Factor $5720$?
      \end{problem}
      {\small
      We already know the divisibility rules for prime numbers $2$, $3$, $5$, and $11$. Let's apply them. 

      First we see that $5720$ is divisible by $2$. Let's do that:
      $5720 \div 2 = 2860$. 

      $2860$ is also divisible by $2$: $2860 \div 2 = 1430$. 

      Continue: $1430 \div 2 = 715$. 

      $715$ is no longer divisible by $2$. Let's try whether it is divisible by $3$. No luck, since $7+1+5=13$, which isn't divisible by $3$. 

      It ends in 5, so it is divisible by $5$: $715 \div 5 = 143$. 
      Then check whether it is divisible by $7$, the remainder is $3$. 
      
      Then check it is divisible by $11$: $143 \div 11 = 13$, which is already a prime number. So}
      \[ 5720 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 5 \times 11 \times 13 = 2^3 \times 5 \times 11 \times 13.\]

      {\color{textBlue} Tips and tricks:}
      {\small
      It is easy to find the prime factors when factors are $2$, $3$, $5$, or $11$. But what if you've already extracted them, but are still not sure whether a~\emph{remainder number} is prime or composite?
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Check the \emph{last digit} if it is even or $5$. Check a~\emph{sum} and an \emph{alternating sum} of numbers, probably it is still divisible by $3$ or $11$.
        \item Then try to divide it by the successive primes: $7$, $13$, $17$, $19$, $23$, $29$, etc. If the last prime you've been attempting to divide by being squared is bigger than your number, your number is a prime. That means you don't need to try primes bigger than $7$ for numbers less than $100$ since $11 \times 11 > 100$ already.
        \item Organize your calculations into something like this:

      The number we just found is called
      \begin{definition}
        The \textbf{Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)} of two counting numbers is the largest counting number that \emph{divides each} of the two given numbers.
      \end{definition}
      
      The GCD of two number is often denoted as $\gcd(a,\ b)$ or simply (in some context) $(a,\ b)$.\medskip

      You've already met the Greatest Common Divisor when study reducing of common fractions.\medskip 

      In the name "greatest common divisor", the adjective "greatest" may be replaced by "highest", and the word "divisor" may be replaced by "factor", so that other names include \textbf{greatest common factor (GCF)}, etc. Historically, other names for the same concept have included the \emph{greatest common measure}.

\begin{frame}{Finding Greatest Common Divisor}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
        To find the \textbf{GCD} of two numbers, it is often helpful to perform a \textbf{prime factorization} of the numbers.

      \begin{definition}
        The GCD is the \textbf{product of all of shared prime factors} of numbers.
      \end{definition}

      \begin{problem}
        What is the GCD of $144$ and $900$?
      \end{problem}
      \vspace*{-1.8ex}
      \[ 144 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2, \qquad 900 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2. \]
      From their prime factorizations, we see that $144$ and $900$ share two factors of $2$ and two factors of~$3$, so $\gcd(144,\ 900) = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 = 36$.

      \begin{example}
        If the GCD of two numbers is $1$, we say the numbers are relatively prime or \textbf{coprime}.                 
      \end{example}
      For example, neither $35$ nor $12$ is a prime number, but they are coprime.\smallskip 

      A prime factorization of huge numbers is a super hard problem. In fact, modern computer security is based that no one can factor huge numbers in a~reasonable time.
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
      But sometimes, the prime factorization itself is a~problem. In this case, the \textbf{Euclidean algorithm} will help. It is based on the fact that     
      \[
        \text{if }a > b\text{, then }\gcd(a,\ b) = \gcd(a − k \cdot b, b).
      \]\vspace*{-0.9\baselineskip}
      \begin{problem}
        What is the GCD of $833$ and $221$?        
      \end{problem}

      The prime factorization isn’t trivial, so we start with division with a reminder:
      \[ \mathbf{833} = \mathbf{221} × 3 + \mathbf{170}. \]
      So we get, that $\gcd(833, 221) = \gcd(221, 170)$. Then we will do next step and continue until we get a reminder $0$, that means the previous value is the GCD
      \begin{align*}
        \mathbf{221} &= \mathbf{170} × 1 + \mathbf{51}, \\
        \mathbf{170} &= \mathbf{51} × 3 + \mathbf{17}, \\
        \mathbf{51} &= \mathbf{17} × 3 + \mathbf{0}.                 
      \end{align*}
      That reminder $0$ says that $51$ is multiple of $17$, so $\gcd(51,\ 17) = 17$, and that means $\gcd(833,\ 221) = 17$.

        Alice has invited friends to a party and wants to buy cookies for everyone. She knows there will be $24$ or $30$ guests, so she wants that everybody to get an equal amount of cookies. What is the \textbf{minimum} amount of cookies should she buy?
      \end{problem}
      \begin{wrapfigure}[8]{r}{0.34\textwidth}

        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{04 - Number Theory 101/coockies.png}
      \end{wrapfigure}

      To split~cookies~equally between $24$~friends,~she can buy $24$, $48$,~$72$,~$96$, $120$, $144$, and so on. 

      To~split~cookies~equally between~$30$~friends,~she can buy $30$,~$60$,~$90$,~$120$, $150$, and so on. 
      
      Therefore, we may see, the minimum amount of cookies she should buy is $120$.

      \begin{definition}
        The \textbf{Least Common Multiple (LCM)} of two counting numbers is the smallest counting number that each of the given numbers divides evenly.  
      \end{definition}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
      The LCM of two numbers is often denoted as $\lcm(a,\ b)$ or simply (in some context) $[a,\ b]$. 

      To find the LCM of two numbers, it is also helpful to perform a \textbf{prime factorization} of the numbers. The LCM of two numbers is the product of all primes in \emph{their maximal power} in the factorization of each number.
      
      \begin{definition}
        What is the LCM of $144$ and $900$?        
      \end{definition}
      \vspace*{-1em}
      \[ 144 = 2^4 3^2, \qquad 900 =2^2 3^2 5^2. \]  
      Their prime factorizations show that maximal power of $2$ is $4$, maximal power of $3$ is $2$, and maximal power of $5$ is also $2$. So 
      \[ \lcm(144,\ 900) = 2^4 3^2 5^2 = 3600. \] 
      Curious mind probably noted, that 
      \[ 144 \times 900 = 36 \times 3600 = 129600. \]
      \vspace*{-1\baselineskip}
      \begin{definition}
        Indeed, $a \times b = \gcd(a,\ b) \times \lcm(a,\ b)$, a proof follows from the prime factorization.

\begin{frame}{The Chicken McNuggets Theorem}

    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
      \begin{problem}
        When they were first introduced, McDonald's Chicken McNuggets came in boxes of $9$ or $20$.  What was the largest number of McNuggets that was not expressible as the sum of integer multiples of $9$ and $20$?
      \end{problem}
      {\small
      Let's look at a simpler version of this problem: 
      \begin{problem}
        What is the largest integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of integer multiples of $3$ and $5$?
      \end{problem}

      To find the solution, we need to find the largest integer by counting upwards before we first find \emph{$3$ integers in a row} that can be expressed as the sum of multiples of $3$ and $5$.  After that, we can simply add factors of $3$ to get the series to repeat to infinity.
      \begin{align*}
        6 &= 2 \times 3, \\
        7 &\text{ cannot be expressed}, \\ 
        8 &= 3 + 5, \\
        9 &= 3 \times 3, \\
        10 &= 2 \times 5. 
      \end{align*} 
      So $7$ is the answer.
      }
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
      For $9$ and $20$, a lot of counting (or a little computer coding) will tell you the answer is $151$, but we can use the following theorem.
      
      {\color{textBlue} Theorem:}
      \begin{definition}
        For \emph{coprime} integers $m$ and $n$, let $L\{m,\ n\}$ be the largest integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of integer multiples $m$ and $n$. Then
        \[ L\{m,\ n\} = mn − m − n. \]
        \vspace*{-1\baselineskip}
      \end{definition}
      Since $9$ and $20$ are coprime ($\gcd(9,\ 20) = 1$),
      \begin{align*}
        L\{9,\ 20\} &= 9 \times 20 - 9 - 20 = 151, \\
        L\{3,\ 5\} &= 3 \times 5 - 3 - 5 = 7.

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
      \begin{problem}
        Is $5479$ divisible by $9$?
      \end{problem}
      Let's write a number 5479 as a sum
      \[ 5472 = 5 \cdot 1000 + 4 \cdot 100 + 7 \cdot 10 + 2. \]
      And then write $1000$ as a sum $999 + 1$, $100 = 99 + 1$ and $10 = 9 + 1$. So 
      \begin{multline*}
        5472 = 5 \cdot (999 + 1) + 4 \cdot (99 + 1) + 7 \cdot (9 + 1) + 9 = \\
        = 5 \cdot 999 + 5 + 4 \cdot 99 + 4 + 7 \cdot 9 + 7 + 2.
      \end{multline*}
      And finally we can realize that $999$, $99$, and $9$ are divisible by $9$. That means that divisibility of $5479$ by $9$ depends on divisibility of sum $5 + 4 + 7 + 2$.
      \begin{definition}
        A number is divisible by $9$, if the \textbf{sum of its digits} is divisible by $9$.
      \end{definition}
      And since $9$, $99$, $999$, $9999$ and so on is also divisible by $3$, we get
      \begin{definition}
        A number is divisible by $3$, if the \textbf{sum of its digits} is divisible by $3$.
      \end{definition}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}

      \begin{example}
        $\overline{abcd}$ is a mathematical notation that a number is written with digits $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. So
        \[ \overline{abcd} = a \cdot 10^3 + b \cdot 10^2 + c \cdot 10 + d. \]
        This allows us to write the rules as
        \[
           \overline{abcd} \equiv a + b + c + d \pmod{9 \text{ or } 3}. 
        \]
        \vspace*{-1em}
      \end{example}\medskip

      The divisibility rule by $9$ allows us quickly check if our arithmetic operations are correct.
      \[
        \begin{array}{c}
        \phantom{\times99}384\\
        \underline{\times\phantom{999}56}\\
        \phantom{\times9}2304\\
        \underline{\phantom\times1820\phantom9}\\
        \phantom\times20504
        \end{array}
      \]
      Lets see remainders of factors and product
      \begin{gather*}
        384 \equiv 6 \Mod{9}, \quad
        56 \equiv 2 \Mod{9}, \\
        20504 \equiv 2 \Mod{9}.
      \end{gather*}
      But $6 \times 2 \not\equiv 2 \Mod{9}$, so there is an error.

\begin{frame}{Divisibility rules for 11}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
      The divisibility rules for $9$ and $3$ works because $10$, $100$, $1{,}000$, and so on are all divisible by $9$ with remainder $1$. But what about $11$?
      \[ 1\underbrace{00\ldots 0}_\text{even zeros} - 1 = \underbrace{99 \ldots 9}_\text{even nines} \]
      is divisible by $11$ because it is sum of
      \[ 99\ 99\ \ldots 99 = 99\cdot 10^n + \ldots + 99 \] which all are divisible by $11$.

      From other hand
      \[ 1\underbrace{00\ldots 0}_\text{odd zeros} + 1 = \underbrace{99\ldots 9}_\text{even nines}0 + 11 \]
      is also divisible by $11$.

      As we see, our final computation is the digits of the number with alternate signs.

      \end{definition}\medskip

      The combinations of the divisibility rules may also create additional divisibility rules.

      You might notice the strange divisibility rule for $7$. The proof of this rule is not straightforward as for all other. 
      
      Let's write $n = a\cdot 10 + b$, where $b$ is the last digit and $a$ is the number build with remaining digits. Then suppose $n$ is divisible by $7$
      \begin{align*}
        a \cdot 10 + b &\equiv 0 \pmod{7}, \text{ multiply all by $2$}\\
        a \cdot 20 + b \cdot 2 &\equiv 0 \pmod{7}, \text{ subtract $21a$}\\
        a \cdot (-1) + b \cdot 2 &\equiv 0 \pmod{7}, \text{ multiply by $-1$}\\
        a - b \cdot 2 &\equiv 0 \pmod{7}.
      \end{align*}
      Doing the same operations in reverse order, we can get the divisibility rule for $7$. This is possible because $2$ and $-1$ are \emph{coprime} with $7$. 
      
      The rule may be repeated several times to get a number small enough for the direct check.

      Similar divisibility rules may be obtained for other primes}

      \begin{enumerate}
        \item[\textbf{13.}] if \emph{adding $4$ times the last digit of $n$ to the remaining digits} gives a multiple of $13$;
        \item[\textbf{17.}] if \emph{subtracting $5$ times the last digit of $n$ from the remaining digits} gives a multiple of $17$.
      \end{enumerate}

      {\small But these rules aren't simpler than divide by the number.}
