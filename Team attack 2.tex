    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The sum of six consecutive positive integers is 2019. What is the largest of these six integers?
        \item How many ways are there to place 8 rooks on a~chessboard so that they do not attack each other?
        \item Find the sum of all 4-digit numbers that can be form with permutations of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
        \item A group of six, including at least three women, is selected from seven men and four women. Find how many ways we can do this.
        \item Determine the greatest number of figures congruent to  \,\begin{mplibcode}
            u := 0.25cm;
            draw (0u, 0u)--(2u, 0u)--(2u, 1u)--(3u, 1u)--(3u, 2u)--(1u, 2u)--(1u, 1u)--(0u, 1u)--cycle;
            draw (1u, 0u)--(1u, 1u)--(2u, 1u)--(2u, 2u);
        \end{mplibcode}\, that can be placed in a $9 \times 9$ grid (without overlapping), such that each figure covers exactly $4$ unit squares. (Hint: try to solve for $3 \times 3$ and $5 \times 5$ grids)
