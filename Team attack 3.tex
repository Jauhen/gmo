        \item Eleven members of the Middle School Math Club each paid the same integer amount for a guest speaker to talk about problem solving at their math club meeting. In all, they paid their guest speaker $\textdollar\underline{1}\underline{A}\underline{2}$. What is the missing digit $A$ of this 3-digit number? % 3
        \item Abe holds 1 green and 1 red jelly bean in his hand. Bob holds 1 green, 1 yellow, and 2 red jelly beans in his hand. Each randomly picks a jelly bean to show the other. What is the probability that the colors match? % 3/8
        \item If $n$ is an integer for which the greatest common factor of $n$ and 18 is 6 and the
        least common multiple of $n$ and 9 is 126, what is the value of $n$? % 42
        \item The 7-digit numbers $\underline{7} \underline{4} \underline{A} \underline{5} \underline{2} \underline{B} \underline{1}$ and $\underline{3} \underline{2} \underline{6} \underline{A} \underline{B} \underline{4} \underline{C}$ are each multiples of 3. What is the largest possible value of a digit $C$? %7
        \item A standard, six-sided die is rolled five times. What is the probability that the five
        rolls are either all the same or all different? % 121/1296
        \item Chloé chooses a real number uniformly at random from the interval $[0, 2017]$. Independently, Laurent chooses a real number uniformly at random from the interval $[0, 4034]$. What is the probability that Laurent's number is greater than Chloé's number? (Assume they cannot be equal) % 3/4
        \item John inserts some number of parentheses into the expression shown to create a valid mathematical expression. What is the smallest possible integer value of John’s expression? 
        \[ 1 \div 2 \div 3 \div 4 \div 5 \div 6 \div 7 \div 8 \div 9 \div 10.\] % 7
