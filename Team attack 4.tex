  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=3mm]
      \item It takes Mary $30$ minutes to walk uphill $1$ km from her home to school, but it takes her only $10$ minutes to walk from school to her home along the same route. What is her average speed, in km/hr, for the round trip?
      \item Members of the Rockham Soccer League buy socks and T-shirts. Socks cost \$4 per pair and each T-shirt costs \$5 more than a pair of socks. Each member needs one pair of socks and a shirt for home games and another pair of socks and a shirt for away games. If the total cost is \$2366, how many members are in the League?
      \item How many non-congruent triangles with perimeter $7$ have integer side lengths?
      \item What is the probability that a randomly drawn positive factor of $60$ is less than $7$?

One more congruent square is attached to an edge at one of the nine positions indicated. How many of the nine resulting polygons can be folded to form a cube with one face missing?
